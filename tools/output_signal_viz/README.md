# Neural Method Output Visualization Tool

In this folder, we provide an interactive Jupyter notebook to visualize test-set neural method output predictions and labels. The notebook, `data_out_viz.ipynb`, given a `.pickle` output file, generated by setting `TEST.OUTPUT_SAVE_DIR` in an experiment config file to a directory path, will assist in plotting the predicted PPG signal against the ground-truth PPG signal label.

Below is an example of what the visualization looks like:
